Here are some suggestions for text skins. You can
try changing some colors or the font/font size if
you want. The standard background color of the
clock is 192 192 192 (light gray), and the standard
text color is 0 0 0 (black).


(¯)	If you have "Age Of Empires II", you'll
 ¯	love this one.
		TextColor=98 49 0
		BackgroundColor=253 235 200
		TextFontName=Papyrus
		TextSize=12

(¯)	This is a good combination in case you have
 ¯	the font "Kristen ITC". Try changing the
	colors to your liking; I chose blue.
		TextColor=0 0 255
		BackgroundColor=192 192 192
		TextFontName=Kristen ITC
		TextSize=10

(¯)	Another good one, specially if you have your
 ¯	Windows98's settings to smooth fonts. Try
	changing the colors too.
		TextColor=0 0 255
		BackgroundColor=192 192 192
		TextFontName=Informal Roman
		TextSize=14

(¯)	This is for people who have the font "Brush
 ¯	Script MT". It's very good too if you have
	smooth fonts.
		TextColor=0 0 255
		BackgroundColor=192 192 192
		TextFontName=Brush Script MT
		TextSize=14
