### Description

Cool Clock is the first ever skinnable substitution for your old System Tray clock!<p>

You can use a *GRAPHICAL* skin, or set the background color, text color and font name/size for a text-based (yet cool if you use the right font) skin!<p>

This is based on the System Tray Status Bar code sample (if you know the name of the person that did this, posted a few days ago, please leave a comment here!), but I did the text/image skins system and all the rest (including the default - and only :( - skin included).<p>

If you want it to appear every time you log on to Windows, make a shortcut for it in your "Start\Programs\Startup" folder.<p>

It's also a must to include with every desktop theme you make (I don't mind as long as my name remains there), to customize Windows even more and impress the users!<p>

And if you have any more skins you make, please send them to me and they'll be posted here along with your name ;)
